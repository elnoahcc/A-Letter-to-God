# 💌 A Letter from God

A beautiful, interactive web experience where users receive a personalized love letter from God — presented through an animated envelope with romantic visual effects.

> **Live Demo:** Hosted via Firebase Hosting

## ✨ Features

### 📬 Interactive Envelope
- A realistic envelope with a **flap** and **pocket** crafted entirely in CSS
- Users enter their name and click **"Open"** to reveal a heartfelt letter
- The flap opens with a smooth 3D rotation, and the letter slides out and centers on screen

### ✍️ Typing Animation
- The letter content is revealed character by character with a natural typing effect
- **4 randomized messages** — each visit shows a different letter, keeping it fresh and personal

### 🌸 Flower Finale
- **10 seconds** after the letter finishes typing, it gently fades out
- A stunning **CSS-animated flower garden** blooms on screen — 3 flowers with stems, leaves, glowing firefly lights, grass, and foliage
- A **fluttering butterfly 🦋** appears alongside the flowers
- A beautiful quote is displayed:
  > *"Bunga di ladang saja Aku rawat, apalagi engkau..."*  
  > — Matius 6:28

### 💕 Romantic Effects
- **Floating hearts** — soft golden hearts drift upward in the background
- **Pulsing button** — the "Open" button gently pulses to invite interaction
- **Heart burst** — a burst of hearts explodes when the button is clicked
- **Background music** — plays a gentle loop of *"Jesus Loves Me"*

### 🎨 Design
- **Fonts:** *Indie Flower* (letter), *Playfair Display* (UI), *Great Vibes* (quote), *Cormorant Garamond* (base)
- **Color palette:** Deep crimson background with gold accents
- **Responsive:** Works beautifully on both desktop and mobile

## 📝 How It Works

1. **User lands on page** → sees the envelope with floating hearts in the background
2. **Enters their name** → types their name in the input field
3. **Clicks "Open"** → heart burst animation + envelope flap opens + letter slides up
4. **Letter centers** → fills the screen and begins the typing animation with a random message
5. **10 seconds after typing ends** → letter fades out gracefully
6. **Flower finale** → animated flowers bloom from the bottom, butterfly flutters, and the scripture quote appears
